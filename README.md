# Pneumonia-Detection-Using-Chest-X-Ray
A machine learning model that can detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images.

Project Overview
This project is a machine learning model that can detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The model was trained on a dataset of about 5,000 chest X-ray images, half of which were of patients with pneumonia and half of which were of patients without pneumonia. The model was able to achieve an accuracy of 98% on the test set.

Dataset
The dataset for this project was obtained from Kaggle.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the ability of machine learning models to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Future work could focus on improving the accuracy of the model.
