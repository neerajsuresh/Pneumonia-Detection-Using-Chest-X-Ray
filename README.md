# Pneumonia-Detection-Using-Chest-X-Ray
A machine learning model that can detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images.

Project Overview
This project is a machine learning model that can detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The model was trained on a dataset of about 5,000 chest X-ray images, half of which were of patients with pneumonia and half of which were of patients without pneumonia.

Dataset
The dataset for this project was obtained from Kaggle.

Deployment
The model was developed with Teachable Machine and is published in Google Servers. The model can be accessed by anyone with a Google Cloud Platform account. To test the model, you can upload a chest X-ray image to the cloud and the model will return a prediction of whether the patient has pneumonia or not.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the ability of machine learning models to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Future work could focus on improving the accuracy of the model.

The model can be used in a variety of ways, including:
Diagnosing pneumonia: Doctors can use the model to help them diagnose pneumonia in their patients.
Developing a mobile app: Healthcare organizations can use the model to develop a mobile app that allows people to upload their chest X-ray images and get a prediction of whether they have pneumonia.
